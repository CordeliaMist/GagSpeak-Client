# Overview
GagSpeak is made with the intent of being more than just a one-sided translator. Gagspeak will allow the user to muffle their speech using a sophisticated garbler algorithm, based on real life gag sound data, to accurately garble speech for each individual gag in their own unique way.

I invested way to much time into safety, security, privacy, and features for this plugin, and I'm very happy with how far things have come.
## For those who just want to install the plugin:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CordeliaMist/Dalamud-GagSpeak/main/repo.json
```

## For Aspiring plugin Developers:
I struggled a fuck ton learning all this shit. I got laughed at, denied, and talked down on by so many other plugin devs while I tried to make this plugin. I am very thankful for the few who helped me learn how to do plugin development for dalamud and enhance my ability to learn and understand C# better.

Because of this, I don't want to have other programmers suffer the same fate as me. As such, I have HEAVILY COMMENTED everywhere in my code explaining why everything is the place it is, and why things are the way they are. Additionally, I have also provided a plugin overview markdown you can find above this readme on the main page. Where I teach you the fundementals, and how I would recommand looking through the code to get a good understanding of how things work so that hopefully you can eventually make your own! Note I'm not perfect and all knowing, but Im sharing what knowledge I know!

### Credits & Thanks:
This is my first plugin, i had to drill myself on this a lot to get it working, and ask for help when i got stuck. So, for those of you who are who you know you are, thank you for helping me every time i got stumped, and putting up with my annoying pokes. Also thank you to Ottermandias for glamourer, as it served for the basis of the plugin structure I commented the fuck out of to learn hjow c# structure works, and plugin structure / format.
